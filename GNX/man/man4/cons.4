.TH CONS 4
.SH NAME
cons \- SYS16 console interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
The console is available to the processor through the CPU Board serial port.
It acts like a normal terminal, except when the system is powered on,
reset, experiences a panic condition, or is rebooted.
Under these conditions,
the console is in local ROM monitor mode.
The system can be booted using the `k' or `o' commands.
The `h' command lists the ROM monitor commands available.
.PP
When certain error conditions arise,
the kernel will print diagnostic messages on the console.
Among others,
these conditions include
hard disk and tape errors,
process deaths due to insufficient swap space,
and system panics.
.SH FILES
/dev/console
.SH "SEE ALSO"
tty(4), reboot(8)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
None.
.SH BUGS
Some versions of the kernel are compiled
with debugging features that affect the console's behavior on input.
In this case,
two character sequences starting with the ASCII character SOH
(control-A)
are interpreted at interrupt level by the kernel itself,
producing various diagnostic printouts
or causing the kernel to take various drastic actions.
To input SOH itself,
it is necessary to type it twice in succession.
