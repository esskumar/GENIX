.SH NAME
lp \- line printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
device lp vector lpintr
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lp
provides the interface to any of the standard
Centronix line printers.
When it is opened or closed, a suitable number
of page ejects is generated.
Bytes written are printed.
.PP
The unit number of the printer is specified by the minor device
after removing the low 3 bits, which act as per-device parameters.
Currently only the lowest of the low three bits is interpreted:
if it is set, the device is treated as having a 64-character set,
rather than a full 96-character set.
In the resulting half-ASCII mode, lower case letters are turned
into upper case and certain characters are escaped according to
the following table:
