.TH ACCT 5
.SH NAME
acct \- execution accounting file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/acct.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR Acct (2)
causes entries to be made into an accounting file
for each process that terminates.
The accounting file is a sequence of entries whose layout,
as defined by the include file
is:
.PP
.nf
.ta \w'typedef 'u +\w'comp_t  'u +\w'ac_comm[10];   'u
/*
 * acct.h	1.2	7/14/83
 */

/*
 * Accounting structures;
 * these use a comp_t type which is a 3 bits base 8
 * exponent, 13 bit fraction ``floating point'' number.
 */
typedef	u_short comp_t;

struct	acct
{
	char	ac_comm[10];		/* Accounting command name */
	comp_t	ac_utime;		/* Accounting user time */
	comp_t	ac_stime;		/* Accounting system time */
	comp_t	ac_etime;		/* Accounting elapsed time */
	time_t	ac_btime;		/* Beginning time */
	short	ac_uid;			/* Accounting user ID */
	short	ac_gid;			/* Accounting group ID */
	short	ac_mem;			/* average memory usage */
	comp_t	ac_io;			/* number of disk IO blocks */
	dev_t	ac_tty;			/* control typewriter */
	char	ac_flag;		/* Accounting flag */
};

#define	AFORK	01		/* has executed fork, but no exec */
#define	ASU	02		/* used super-user privileges */
.fi
.PP
If the process does an
.IR exec (2),
the first 10 characters of the filename appear in
.I ac_comm.
The accounting flag contains bits indicating whether
.IR exec (2)
was ever accomplished, and whether the
process ever had super-user privileges.
