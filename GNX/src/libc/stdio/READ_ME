Floating point has been restored to doscan.c. The function atof has
been "borrowed" from the system 3 code. It uses the functions (and files)
ldexp and frexp. All of this code is written in C and should optimally be
re-coded in native assembly language.

I am installing the .O files into the library which I have produced because
they were generated by the new compiler which supports floating point.

NOTE:
If these files are remade, they must be remade with a compiler which supports
floating point. The affected files are atof.c, ldexp.c frexp.c.
